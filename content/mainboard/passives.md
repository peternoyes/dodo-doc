#### Background

A number of passive components have been listed on the previous pages including resistors, diodes, and capacitors. The only remaining components to be described are the 0.01uF bypass capacitors. These should have 103 printed on the case. A bypass capacitor is located next to each IC as close to the VCC pin as possible.
