#### 65C51

Dodo requires a connection to a host computer in order to flash games onto the cartridges and to update the system firmware on the EEPROM. That connection is RS-232. RS-232 connectivity is provided by the 65C51 communication adapter, and the MAX202CPE in order to convert the TTL logic levels of the 65C51 to RS-232. A few external components are necessary. The 1.8342mhz oscillator feeds the internal baud rate generator inside of the 65C51, and a number of capacitors provide the charge pump for the MAX202 that needs to scale to higher voltages.

#### 65C51 Pin Descriptions

| Pin(s)      | Discription                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| TxD         | Transmit line, connected to MAX202CPE
| RxD         | Receive line, connected to MAX202CPE
| XTL0        | Unconnected because bare crystal not used
| XTL1        | Connected to the 1.8432 oscillator
| RxC         | Unconnected
| RS0, RS1    | Register address lines. Connected to A0 - A1. Chip select is generated based on the other address lines, least significan 2 bits determine register.

| CS1B        | Chip Select 1, connected to the 65C51 select generated by the [glue logic](/mainboard/gluelogic)
| CS0         | Chip select 0. Tied High, not needed
| RWB         | Read/Write Connected to RW from the processor
| IRQB        | Interrupt line, connected to IRQ of processor
| RESB        | Connected to the Reset line
| PHI2        | Connected to the 1mhz oscillator
| DSRB        | Unused. Tied to GND
| DCDB        | Unused. Tied to GND
| DTRB        | Unconnected
| RTSB        | Control line connected to MAX202CPE
| CTSB        | Control line connected to MAX202CPE
